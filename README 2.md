sample codes all about Android UI

### What's applied?
- Jsoup for pasing html tags.
- Glide for image loading and cache.
- MVP for application architecture. (For the time being, I'm middle of considering what's better between data-binding from Google and RxBinding by Jake Wharton.)
- RxJava, RxAndroid for asynchronous communication and replacing for-loop.
- RetroLambda for using lambda expressions.
- Gson for serializing/deserialzing json which is performance effective as long as json string length is little(<300KB~500KB)
- GreenRobot eventbus for event communication among activities, fragments, services.
- ButterKnife for injecting dependencies like Views, Resources, e.g. string, color, integer values.
- json2pojo for creating automatically POJO java files from plain json string.
